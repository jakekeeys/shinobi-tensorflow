## "is my camera supported?"

Ask yourself these questions to get a general sense.

- Does it have ONVIF?
    - If yes, then it may have H.264 or H.265 streaming capability.
- Does it have RTSP Protocol for Streaming?
    - If yes, then it may have H.264 or H.265 streaming capability.
- Can you stream it in VLC Player?
    - If yes, use that same URL in Shinobi. You may need to specify the port number when using `rtsp://` protocol.
- Does it have MJPEG Streaming?
    - While this would work in Shinobi, it is far from ideal. Please see if any of the prior questions are applicable.
- Does it have a web interface that you can connect to directly?
    - If yes, then you may be able to find model information that can be used to search online for a streaming URL.
